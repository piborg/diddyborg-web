This module is designed to communicate with the ThunderBorg

Use by creating an instance of the class, call the Init function, then command as desired, e.g.
import ThunderBorg
TB = ThunderBorg.ThunderBorg()
TB.Init()
# User code here, use TB to control the board

Multiple boards can be used when configured with different I²C addresses by creating multiple instances, e.g.
import ThunderBorg
TB1 = ThunderBorg.ThunderBorg()
TB2 = ThunderBorg.ThunderBorg()
TB1.i2cAddress = 0x15
TB2.i2cAddress = 0x1516
TB1.Init()
TB2.Init()
# User code here, use TB1 and TB2 to control each board separately

For explanations of the functions available call the Help function, e.g.
import ThunderBorg
TB = ThunderBorg.ThunderBorg()
TB.Help()
