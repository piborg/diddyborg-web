This module is designed to communicate with the ZeroBorg

Use by creating an instance of the class, call the Init function, then command as desired, e.g.
import ZeroBorg
ZB = ZeroBorg.ZeroBorg()
ZB.Init()
# User code here, use ZB to control the board

Multiple boards can be used when configured with different I²C addresses by creating multiple instances, e.g.
import ZeroBorg
ZB1 = ZeroBorg.ZeroBorg()
ZB2 = ZeroBorg.ZeroBorg()
ZB1.i2cAddress = 0x44
ZB2.i2cAddress = 0x45
ZB1.Init()
ZB2.Init()
# User code here, use ZB1 and ZB2 to control each board separately

For explanations of the functions available call the Help function, e.g.
import ZeroBorg
ZB = ZeroBorg.ZeroBorg()
ZB.Help()
