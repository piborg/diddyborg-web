"""
This module is designed to communicate with the Diablo

Use by creating an instance of the class, call the Init function, then command as desired, e.g.
import Diablo
DIABLO = Diablo.Diablo()
DIABLO.Init()
# User code here, use DIABLO to control the board

Multiple boards can be used when configured with different I²C addresses by creating multiple instances, e.g.
import Diablo
DIABLO1 = Diablo.Diablo()
DIABLO2 = Diablo.Diablo()
DIABLO1.i2cAddress = 0x44
DIABLO2.i2cAddress = 0x45
DIABLO1.Init()
DIABLO2.Init()
# User code here, use DIABLO1 and DIABLO2 to control each board separately

For explanations of the functions available call the Help function, e.g.
import Diablo
DIABLO = Diablo.Diablo()
DIABLO.Help()
